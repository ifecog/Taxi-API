## General Info
Many modern ride-sharing apps rely on efficient, real-time, and bi-directional communication to provide users with a seamless and exceptional experience. One prime example is a ride-sharing platform akin to Uber, InDrive, Bolt, or Lyft, which is intricately built on the exchange of messages between riders and drivers. This Taxi REST API facilitates the core functionality of such a service.

Download and install Redis and in a new terminal window, start the Redis server. Make sure that it is running on its default port, 6379.
```
$ redis-server
```
If youâ€™re on a Mac, it is recommended that you use Homebrew for both PostgreSQL and Redis:

## Features
User Interactions:

    Requesting a Ride:
        A rider initiates the process by selecting their current location and desired destination.
        The system broadcasts a trip request to all available nearby drivers.

    Driver Response:
        An available driver acknowledges the trip request and accepts the ride assignment.
        The driver proceeds to the rider's specified pick-up location.

    Real-time Tracking:
        Throughout the ride, every move the driver makes is transmitted in near real-time to the rider.
        The rider can closely monitor the trip's status as long as it remains active.

Key Features:

    Trip Management: The API manages the creation, tracking, and completion of trips, ensuring a smooth rider-driver interaction.

    Real-time Updates: It facilitates instant communication of driver movements to riders, allowing them to follow the trip progress.

    Secure Transactions: The API ensures secure and transparent transactions between riders and drivers, including fare calculation and payment processing.

    Geospatial Integration: Leveraging geospatial data, the API accurately determines driver availability and trip routing.

    User Authentication: Robust user authentication mechanisms safeguard the integrity of the platform.
